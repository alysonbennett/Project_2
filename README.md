## Process
We started this project with brainstorming ideas for what we would want our application to do, and how users would interact with it. After deciding on a type of app that would help dog owners with boarding their dogs, we also began sketching how we want the app to look. Then we began working on the html and handlebars with back end being one of the last things to work on.
